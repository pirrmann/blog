As explained in the [Gmail blog][1], the really annoying bug of the
"mark as unread" button is now fixed.

Before if you had a new post in a really old thread with dozens of mails and
marked it unread, all the messages in the thread were marked as unread,
expanding them all ! It was really annoying as for long threads it meant
scrolling a lot to find the last mail really unread message.

Good job, but now a "mark all messages after this one as unread" option on each
message seem needed.
